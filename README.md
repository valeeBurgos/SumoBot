# SumoBot
In this repository you will find all the information to build a sumo robot.

A sumo robot is a type of robot designed to compete in the sport of robotic sumo, a competition in which robots compete to push their opponent out of a circular ring using a variety of techniques and strategies. Sumo robots are generally small and round, with a large amount of power in their motors to forcefully push their opponent.

In robotic sumo competitions, robots must adhere to certain rules, such as the maximum size and weight allowed, and must be able to detect ring lines and avoid cheating. Sumo robots must also be able to operate autonomously during combat, as human controllers are not allowed in the ring.

In the "Hardware" folder you can find everything related to the physical development of the project, including the list of commercial materials, materials manufactured with indications and original files (for example, 3D printing), assembly instructions, observations and recommendations.

In the "Software" folder you can find what is related to the code used. This is programmed in Arduino IDE and the algorithm will be explained in general terms.
